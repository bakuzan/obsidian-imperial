# Imperial - An Obsidian Theme

Personal theme for Obsidian

For the legacy version of the theme, I used [Red Graphite](https://github.com/seanwcom/Red-Graphite-for-Obsidian) as a starting point and adjusted to suit my tastes.

The v1.0 version of the theme is a thin colour layer over the top of the default light obsidian theme.
